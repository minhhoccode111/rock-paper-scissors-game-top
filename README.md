# rock-paper-scissors

practice javaScript DOM with rock paper scissors game vs computer
what I've learned :

- using bootstrap framework and using animate.css library
- write right JS that's worked
- const element = document.getElementById("demo");
  setInterval(function() {element.innerHTML += "Hello"}, 1000);
  use setInterval and forEach() to do animation print something word by word
- select element with attribute document.querySelectorAll(`button[type="button"]`) //EX
- add class .skip to element by using classList.add to skip animation when user do 'click' or 'keydown' event
- and more.

What I can do better :

- use JS DOM to add animation switch page
- use only 1 or 2 pages and use JS DOM to notify events to user (not to create multiple pages and notify user by link them to another pages)
- and a lot more stuffs but I'll leave it for later
